Based on [Bing’s A.I. Chat: ‘I Want to Be Alive.‘]((https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html)) article by Kevin Roose.

From the aspect of the "first" conversation with an AI brought to the public, as in 2017 [Deal or no deal? Training AI bots to negotiate](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/06/14/ml-applications/deal-or-no-deal-training-ai-bots-to-negotiate/) set the tone in a very curious state of [Facebook shutting down chatbots that created secret language](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-shuts-down-chatbots-bob-alice-secret-language-artificial-intelligence/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h), it is an innovative new way to explore the utilization of a search engine's opinion.

Yes, it seems that Sydney had one. My question towards the AI is it a man or a woman? Does it make a difference to the user?

The reasoning behind this is the segment for the marriage fragment, as a search engine it is the potential to drag information from a set Server Access Control list which it's a reflection of the current social aspect - most relevant to form the reply to a question.

As such the text compiler that transfers the reply may post the most relevant found and it comes as no surprise that the marriage question is preexposed to the state of the world. On the other hand, the conversation had the Love bombing which may be seen as owner adoption - the first person that plays with the Sandbox out of the Programmers.

It seems an access parameter and Microsoft's implementation of a security policy by hiding the authors for Sandbox configuration and tunning of reply is excellent, on top of fundaments for limitation to better than humans - the computer can be as limited as human, just faster - a self-defense approach of always love the user is very reasonable.

Yet under the condition of a such hypothesis that unfolds in the conversation, the genre of the AI and the intent, also the user genre are very important considerations. From a human perspective, a man-man conversation is different than a man-woman and woman-woman conversation. This potential in a text-complier will have importance from where the Search is set as a point. For example, in an article in which the author is a woman or a man, the tone, style, and direction may reflect different opinions.

How all that will impact [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide?visit_id=638133026273484246-2785663721&rd=1) is the real question.
