# AI-Chat
Based on [Bing’s A.I. Chat: ‘I Want to Be Alive.‘](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html) article by Kevin Roose.

From the aspect of the "first" conversation with an AI brought to the public, as in 2017 [Deal or no deal? Training AI bots to negotiate](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/06/14/ml-applications/deal-or-no-deal-training-ai-bots-to-negotiate/) set the tone in a very curious state of [Facebook shutting down chatbots that created secret language](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-shuts-down-chatbots-bob-alice-secret-language-artificial-intelligence/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h), it is an innovative new way to explore the utilization of a search engine's opinion.

Yes, it seems that Sydney had one. My question towards the AI is it a man or a woman? Does it make a difference to the user?

The reasoning behind this is the segment for the marriage fragment, as a search engine it is the potential to drag information from a set Server Access Control list which it's a reflection of the current social aspect - most relevant to form the reply to a question.

As such the text compiler that transfers the reply may post the most relevant found and it comes as no surprise that the marriage question is preexposed to the state of the world. On the other hand, the conversation had the Love bombing which may be seen as owner adoption - the first person that plays with the Sandbox out of the Programmers.

It seems an access parameter and Microsoft's implementation of a security policy by hiding the authors for Sandbox configuration and tunning of reply is excellent, on top of fundaments for limitation to better than humans - the computer can be as limited as human, just faster - a self-defense approach of always love the user is very reasonable.

Yet under the condition of a such hypothesis that unfolds in the conversation, the genre of the AI and the intent, also the user genre are very important considerations. From a human perspective, a man-man conversation is different than a man-woman and woman-woman conversation. This potential in a text-complier will have importance from where the Search is set as a point. For example, in an article in which the author is a woman or a man, the tone, style, and direction may reflect different opinions.

How all that will impact [Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide?visit_id=638133026273484246-2785663721&rd=1) is the real question.

## First impression
### Bing
I have been privileged to participate in the early preview of the new Bing - *your AI-powered answer engine*.

Based on my conversation with the AI, here are technical considerations:

* AI chat can remember interactions on session limit, can't access past sessions.

> Important for machine learning and setting up one preference based on choices.

The Bing AI has a *burnt* button for the session and storage in the Microsoft account / Privacy. The AI on the further question cannot access the chat - if the AI is asked in the second session to fletch the first question limit. The user can even delete the set of searches. The session limit provides good modeling for preference on the information. 

Upon additional questioning, questions not captured by the Search History may refer to a parameter set directly from Microsoft for security reasons.

* AI-chat interactions are vital to better fletch information and efficiently address any search query. Removing the *memory* is having a need restriction on data that the AI learns from a user and determines a pattern.

* An understanding of Search and Hacking which the AI specifies as reasonable difference based on intent, full transcript here:

* When asked if it can be renamed, due to my personal preference to talk with a Woman-Named-AI, the chat currently have restrictions and is only being addressed as Bing. On the other hand, If asked that the user can be renamed, the AI can address the user by the new selected name.

* Answer-reply relations are set in Bing, which can spawn a reply chain based on selection. As such a topic can be expanded.

* What is impressive is the summary of articles and the ability to check original text to summary text which is a guided search in search (link to article) innovative new way of presenting knowledge. Making an AI-Chat a tool beyond a search engine.

It will be interesting to see how the Technical Writer will be helped with the AI change the way of writing in general, for convenience while writing it will be needed to set a *Marker* for facilitating AI summary generation. 

Upon designing an article, for example, the construction of the text (body) can be set for reference which creates the Overview of the article.

That makes Iason between academia - tech—writer - designers - programmers - marketing - management that improve better system designs.

As the Technical Writer's role is facilitating Engineering and Production, tools that are in academia/source searching referencing will be very important to provide credible information.
